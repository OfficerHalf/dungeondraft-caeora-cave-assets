# Important Notes
## What This Is

The folder structure and metadata to allow you to use Caeora's [Cave Assets Complete][cave-assets] asset pack in [Dungeondraft][dungeondraft] with tags already set up.

## What This Is Not

- The actual assets. You must purchase those from Caeora.
- Dungeondraft. You must purchase that from Megasploot.

# Use
## Preparing the Pack

1. Clone this repo somewhere.
2. If you want the non-shadowed versions of the assets, copy all of the PNGs from `Cave Assets Complete Pack.zip/Cave Assets` into the `textures/objects` folder of the cloned repo.
3. If you want the shadowed versions of the assets, copy all of the PNGs from `Cave Assets Complete Pack.zip/Cave Assets With Shadow` into the `textures/objects` folder of the cloned repo.
3. Open Dungeondraft and click Menu > Package Custom Assets
4. Browse for the base folder, selecting the cloned repo.
5. Put in a name for the pack, like Caeora Cave Assets, and an author (Caeora) if you'd like.
6. Click 'Package'.
7. Open the assets selection and enable the asset pack.

## Notes

You can use the assets with shadows, the assets without shadows, or both. You could also pack them into separate packs. I find the larger assets look better using Dungeondraft's shadows, but the smaller assets look better using no shadows or the shadowed version of the asset.
